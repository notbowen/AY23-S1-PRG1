#Background
#==========
#Tom is playing scrabble with his group of friends. He has drawn 5 letters from
#the bag. Tom wants to count the number of possible 5-letters words he can form.
#Factorial functions are frequently used to identify the number of ways to arrange
#a group of objects.

#Given the number of objects as n,
#	Factorial of n = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x (n-3) x â€¦ x 2 x 1
#	e.g. factorial of 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

#Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the number of letters, and calculate
#the number of possible n-letters word combination that can be formed.

#Note: There is no need to consider if the words are found in a dictionary.


#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You are to complete this question with a variation of while and if statements.
#3) You MUST use the following variables
#   - number_of_letters
#   - result

#Calculate the number of possible n-letters words
def factorial(number_of_letters):
    if number_of_letters == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return number_of_letters * factorial(number_of_letters - 1)  #Do not remove this line


#Prompt user to enter the number of letters he/she has in her hands
number_of_letters = 1
    
#Do not remove the next line that calls the function and get the result
result = factorial(number_of_letters)

#Modify to display the output with appropriate description
print("There is/are {} way(s) to arrange the word.".format(result))


#input 5, output 120
#input 0, output 1
#input 1, output 1
