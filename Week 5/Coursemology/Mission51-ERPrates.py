#   ERP Rates at Orchard Cordon gantry   #

#Background
#==========
#Any cars entering Orchard Road from Scotts Road from Monday to Friday will
#have to pay the following ERP charges depending on the time of entry.

#Write a Python program to check how much the ERP rate is and to deduct this
#amount from the cash card and display its new value.

#The program is to prompt user for the current value in the cash card and the
#time of entry into Orchard Road. Pass these values into the function, which
#determines the erp rate. If there's erp charges, checks whether the card has
#sufficient balance, deducts the charges from the card if there's sufficient
#balance. Sets the deduction status. Returns the erp rate, card value and
#deduction status as a list. Display the results return from the function with
#appropriate messages.
#You may use float value for the time of entry and assume that the value is
#always valid. 

#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You MUST use the following variables
#   - time_of_entry
#   - card_value
#   - erp_rate
#   - successful_deduction
