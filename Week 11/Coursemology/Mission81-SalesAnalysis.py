#Background
#==========
#Tom is given a file that contains monthly sales data for a company. Each
#line of the file represents a month and consists of the month name followed
#by the sales amount for each day of that month, separated by commas.
#As the company does not open every day, there may not be as many sales data
#as the number of days for the month.

#Tom would like you to help to write a Python program to find the total sales
#for each month.

#START CODING FROM HERE
#======================

#Function that takes the name of the data file, finds the total sales for
#each month in the data file and returns it as a nested list.
#The nested list should contain 12 elements, where each element is a list
#with month name and total sales for the month
def calculate_sales(filename):
    results = []
    
    # Add your code here
    with open(filename) as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    data = [month.split(',') for month in data]

    for month in data:
        sales = [int(i.strip()) for i in month[1:]]
        results.append([month[0], sum(sales)])
    
    return results #do not remove this line
                       
#Prompt user for name of data file
filename = "./Week 11/Coursemology/sales_data.txt"
    
#Do not remove the next line that calls the function
results = calculate_sales(filename)

#Modify to print the result as shown in the question in Coursemology
print(results)
