#########################

# Background
# ==========
# Tom wants to multiply a 3x3 matrix with a 3x1 matrix.
# Write a Python program to multiply matrix A with matrix B
# and store the result in matrix C, which is a 3x1 matrix.


# Important Notes
# ===============
# 1) You MUST use the variables, A, B, C


# START CODING FROM HERE
# ======================

# define the function to multiply matrix A with matrix B, store
# the product in matrix C and return
def matrix_multiplication(A, B):
    C = []

    for i in range(len(A)):
        total = 0
        for j in range(len(B)):
            total += A[i][j] * B[j]
        C.append(total)

    
    return C  # do not remove this line


# Define matrix A as a nested list and matrix B as a list
# remove these statements when submitting in Coursemology
# A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# B = [1, 2, 3]

# Do not remove the next line that calls the function
C = matrix_multiplication(A, B)

# Display the result
print(C)
